<b> Lab | <b> C programming Lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. (KCS-101/KCS-201)	Write A Program to find the sum of digits of the entered number.
 <b> Experiment|    <b> 2. (KCS-101/KCS-201)	Write A Program to find the reverse of a number.




<h5> Objective : </h5>

To be familiar with syntax and structure of C-programming
To learn problem solving techniques using C
To introduce students to the basic knowledge of programming fundamentals of C language. 
To impart writing skill of C programming to the students and solving problems.

<h5> About the Experiment : Write A Program to find the sum of digits of the entered number </h5>

Type here: The main idea to find sum of digits can be divided in three steps.

Extract last digit of the given number.
Add the extracted last digit to sum.
Remove last digit from given number. As it is processed and not required any more.
If you repeat above three steps till the number becomes 0. 
Finally you will be left with sum of digits.

<h5> About the Experiment : Write A Program to find the reverse of a number </h5>






<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Type here: Students from First year engineering of all discipline can learn C as first Programming Language

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

Type here: First Year Engineering : C Programming 

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

Type here: Shivaji University, Kolhapur
