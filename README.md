<b> Lab | <b> C programming Lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. (KCS-101/KCS-201)	Write A Program to find the sum of digits of the entered number.
 
<h5> Objective : </h5>

To be familiar with syntax and structure of C-programming
To learn problem solving techniques using C
To introduce students to the basic knowledge of programming fundamentals of C language. 
To impart writing skill of C programming to the students and solving problems.

<h5> About the Experiment : Write A Program to find the sum of digits of the entered number </h5>

Type here: The main idea to find sum of digits can be divided in three steps.

Step 1 : Extract last digit of the given number. <br>
Step 2 : Add the extracted last digit to sum. <br>
Step 3 : Remove last digit from given number. As it is processed and not required any more.<br>
Step 4 : If you repeat above three steps till the number becomes 0. <br>
Step 5 : Finally you will be left with sum of digits.<br>


<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Type here: Students from First year engineering of all discipline can learn C as first Programming Language

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

Type here: First Year Engineering : C Programming 

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

Type here: Shivaji University, Kolhapur
